To  
The Election Commission of India

Sub: Requesting action against Shri Narendra Modi, a star campaigner of the Bhartiya Janata Party for his acts of violation of the Model Code of Conduct

Sir,

This is to bring to your notice the latest instance of violation of the Model Code of Conduct by Shri Narendra Modi, the star campaigner of the Bhartiya Janata Party. The MCC clearly says:

‚ÄúNo party or candidate shall include in any activity which may aggravate existing differences or create mutual hatred or cause tension between different castes and communities, religious or linguistic.

There shall be no appeal to caste or communal feelings for securing votes. Mosques, Churches, Temples or other places of worship shall not be used as a forum for election propaganda.‚Äù

Further, according to Section 123(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951: ‚ÄúAppeals by a candidate, or any other person with the consent of a candidate, to vote or refrain from voting on the ground of his religion, race, caste, community or language is a corrupt electoral practice. Section 123(3A) denounces any attempt by a candidate to promote feelings of enmity or hatred among citizens on these grounds during elections. Anyone found guilty of corrupt electoral practice can be debarred from contesting elections for a maximum period of up to six years.‚Äù

Shri Narendra Modi blatantly violated this code and the RPA, 1951 by making a speech in one of his election meetings on 22 April, 2024 at Banswara in the state of Rajasthan aiming at not only appealing to 'communal feelings' but also instigating and aggravating hatred in the Hindus against Muslims.

Kindly note the words that he used in his speech as reported by The Indian Express and other media platforms (https://indianexpress.com/elections/pm-modi-rajasthan-congress-muslims-9283196/):

""Pehle jab unki sarkar thi, unhone kaha tha ki desh ki sampati par pehla adhikar Musalmano ka hai. Iska matlab, ye sampati ikatthi karke kisko baatenge? Jinke zyada bacche hain, unko baatenge, ghuspaithiyon ko baatenge. Kya aapki mehnat ki kamayi ka paisa ghuspaithiyon ko diya jayega? Aapko manzoor hai yeh? (Earlier, when they (the Congress) were in power, they had said Muslims have the first right to the wealth of the nation. This means they will distribute this wealth to those who have more children, to infiltrators. Should your hard-earned money be given to infiltrators? Do you agree to this)?""

Shri Modi is resorting to lies, which of course is not mentioned as a violation of the MCC. The previous United Progressive Alliance government led by Dr. Manmohan Singh had clearly said in 2006:

""‚Ä¶ our collective priorities are clear: agriculture, irrigation and water resources, health, education, critical investment in rural infrastructure, and the essential public investment needs of general infrastructure, along with programmes for the upliftment of SC/STs, other backward classes, minorities and women and children. The component plans for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes will need to be revitalized. We will have to devise innovative plans to ensure that minorities, particularly the Muslim minority, are empowered to share equitably in the fruits of development. They must have the first claim on resources. The Centre has a myriad other responsibilities whose demands will have to be fitted within the overall resource availability.""

Nowhere does it say that Muslims would have the first right over the wealth of the nation. But Shri Modi distorted the statement and peddled a lie with a clear objective of creating fear in the Hindus that the opposition Congress Party would give the wealth of the country to Muslims.

Shri Modi equated Muslims as a population which produces more children and is infiltrators.

Shri Modi repeats it:

 ""Ye Congress ka manifesto keh raha hai, ki woh mataon aur beheno ke sone ka hisaab karenge, uski jarthi karenge, jaanakari lenge aur phir woh sampati ko baant denge. Aur unko baatenge, jinko Manmohan Singh ji ki sarkar ne kaha tha ki sampati par pehla adhikar Musalmanon ka hai. Bhaiyon aur behno, yeh Urban Naxal ki soch, meri mataon, behno, aapka mangal sutra bhi bachne nahi denge (Congress's manifesto says they will take stock of the gold mothers and daughters have, and will distribute that wealth. Manmohan Singh's government had said Muslims have the first right to wealth. Brothers and sisters, this Urban Naxal thinking will not spare even the mangal sutras of my mothers and sisters),"".

Here again Shri Modi is resorting to lies as nowhere in the election manifesto of the Congress Party is it said that it will collect information about the gold owned by Hindu women and distribute it among Muslims.

This speech of Shri Narendra Modi has gone viral and reached all parts of the country. One can imagine the impact of this speech on the minds of the people, Hindus and Muslims both. Shri Modi has violated the MCC in this election campaign even before when he said that every page of the manifesto of the Congress Party bears the imprint of the Muslim League.

You would agree that the latest speech of Shri Narendra Modi is aimed at creating tension and enmity between Hindus and Muslims and instigating Hindus to see Muslims as infiltrators and their enemies. It is a clear violation of the MCC.

We request you therefore to censure Shri Narendra Modi and impose a ban on his campaign because it has the potential of tearing apart the social fabric of India.

Thanking You,",111,IndianSocialists,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSocialists/comments/1ca5m9d/letter_to_eci_to_ban_narendra_modi/,1ca5m9d,16.0,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSocialists/comments/1ca5m9d/letter_to_eci_to_ban_narendra_modi/,2024-04-22 14:04:06

Thankyou jharkhand ,"A distressing incident was reported from Jharkhand's Dumka district, where a Spanish tourist was gang-raped on Friday night. The event unfolded in the Kurumahat area within the jurisdiction of the Hansdiha police station. According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), the tourist and her partner were spending the night in a makeshift tent when the incident occurred.

Santosh Kumar, the Jarmundi Sub Divisional Police Officer, indicated that further details about the incident would be disclosed at a later time. It was reported that the couple had traveled from Bangladesh on a two-wheeler, intending to proceed to Nepal via Bihar.

Initial reports suggest that seven to eight local youths were involved in the heinous act, with three of the suspects already apprehended by the authorities. Efforts are ongoing to capture the remaining individuals implicated in the crime.

The victim has since been admitted to a local hospital for medical care. In response to the incident, Banna Gupta, the State Health Minister, expressed his lack of complete information on the matter but emphasized the government's commitment to taking stringent legal action against the perpetrators, regardless of the victim's nationality.

The incident has sparked significant concern and criticism among local leaders. Babulal Marandi, the President of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Jharkhand, raised concerns about the impact such crimes could have on tourism, questioning the safety of foreign visitors in the state. Nishikant Dubey, a BJP Member of Parliament, linked the gang rape to broader issues of safety and governance in Jharkhand, stating that the incident had escalated to an international concern.

This alarming event coincided with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Jharkhand, during which he voiced serious apprehensions regarding the state's law and order situation and the prevalence of extortion activities.",3327,ranchi,https://i.redd.it/atabn337gwlc1.jpeg,1b4lf88,321.0,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/ranchi/comments/1b4lf88/thankyou_jharkhand/,2024-03-02 16:08:29

How Electoral Bonds affected Healthcare,"I'm sure it baffled many as to why pharma companies and hospitals purchased electoral bonds and donated to political parties! It begs the question, did it affect healthcare and associated policy-making in the country?

A total of **35 pharmaceutical companies** purchased electoral bonds worth nearly Rs 800 crores. The Wire reported that majority of these companies are members of either the IDMA, the IPA, or both, which are the two largest associations of pharma companies in India. And it seems that they received favors in return from the government. 

For example, the NMC issued new ethics guidelines regarding the professional conduct of doctors on August 2 last year. The guidelines, among other things, sought to ban pharma company-sponsored medical conferences. Funnily enough, the NMC issued a second notification on August 23, that revoked the entire set of regulations. And what happened in between? Representatives of the IMA and IPA held a meeting with Mansukh Mandaviya (Minister of Health and Family Welfare). Note that the new guidelines also directed doctors to prescribe only generic medicines, to which the IMA raised concerns regarding uncertainty of drug quality, but that's another issue.

Now let's come to the part where serious issues with drug quality were ignored. At least 7 companies were involved.

* **Hetero Labs and Hetero Healthcare**: The Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration issued 6 notices 6 notices to this company in 10 months(!), some of which concerned the drug Remdesevir, during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

https://preview.redd.it/r64qz5zfefqc1.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=72bf4f974896a2d5e3df10511648cbd2564eff37

Hetero Pharma then purchased bonds worth **Rs 40 crores in April 2022**. No action was taken against the company. It again donated bonds worth **Rs 10 crores in October 2023 to the BJP**, after IT raids on October 6 found unaccounted income of nearly Rs 550 crores.

* **Torrent Pharma**: The Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration found in 2018 that the antiplatelet medicine manufactured by this company failed quality tests. Even the USFDA issued warning to the firm for repeated quality failures in October 2019. Further substandard drugs were found by the Gujarat and Maharashtra Drug Administrations in 2019, 2021 and 2023. Yet, no action was taken. Torrent Pharma donated bonds worth **77.5 crores between 2019 and 2024**, most of which went to the BJP. A few went to the TMC, Congress and AAP.

This post deals with the remaining five companies.

* **Glenmark:** They received 4 notices from the Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration (abbreviated FDA hereon) and 1 by the USFDA. The USFDA in its warning letter to Glenmark chairman on November 22, 2022 reads (it inspected Glenmark facility in May 2022):
   * Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B).
   * The Maharashtra FDA flagged Glenmark's blood pressure regulating medicine Telma as substandard in 2022 and 2023.

Glenmark purchased bonds worth **9.75 crores on 11th November 2022**. The entire amount went to the BJP.

* **Zydus Healthcare:** An article by the Mint reports that several hospitals across UP, Rajasthan, Bihar Maharashtra and Gujarat reported patients falling sick after getting remdesevir. At least 1 death was recorded too. In all the cases, the manufacturer was Zydus Cadila. Among the five states, only the Bihar drug regulator tested the drugs and identified the cause.

Zydus purchased bonds worth **Rs 29 crores between 2022 and 2023**. 18 crores went to the BJP, 3 crores to Congress and 8 crores to the SKM. Here's the link to the Mint article reporting adverse reactions due to the drug:

* **IPCA Laboratories:** This company donated Rs 10 crores to the BJP (November 2022) and Rs 3.5 crores to the SKM (January and October 2023). In 2018, its anti-parasitic medicine Lariago was found substandard and flagged by the Maharashtra FDA.
* **Intas Pharmaceutical**: In 2020, the drug Enapril-5 manufactured by Intas failed the dissolution test by the Maharashtra FDA. It donated 20 crores to the BJP in October 2022. Note here that no action was taken on Intas Pharma. The USFDA issued a warning letter in November 2023 for violation of CGMP at its Ahmedabad plant.

IT Department has evidence on unaccounted transactions by Megha Group to Congress: Delhi High Court,"The Delhi High Court Friday said that the Income Tax Department prima facie had ‚Äúsubstantial and concrete evidence‚Äù to further scrutinise the income of Congress for the years 2014-15 to 2020-21 under the Income Tax Act [Indian National Congress Vs. Deputy Commissioner Of Income Tax Central - 19 & Anr].

A division bench of Justice Yashwant Varma and Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav noted that the Satisfaction Note drawn by the Assessing Officer makes detailed reference to unaccounted transactions with respect to the Lok Sabha Elections of 2019 and the Madhya Pradesh Assembly Elections of 2018 and 2013.

""On a prima facie examination, it is evident that the respondents appear to have collated substantial and concrete evidence warranting further scrutiny and examination under the Income Tax Act,"" the Court said.

There is specific reference to unaccounted transactions pertaining to assessment years 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17, said the Court while noting that income which allegedly ‚Äúescaped assessment"" stands at about ‚Çπ520 crores.

In the decision, the Court particularly referred to the documents recovered from Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited (MEIL) Group and said it appears that unaccounted transfers were made to the political party.

‚ÄúThe search documents recovered from the MEIL Group appear to indicate unaccounted transfers to the political party during AYs‚Äò 2017-18 to 2020-21.‚Äù

Pertinently, the MEIL is reported to have been the highest donor to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with ‚Çπ584 crore through the electoral bonds scheme, which was recently quashed by the Supreme Court.

Why is social media (reddit/twitter) hyping that BJP will lose?,"I don‚Äôt sense anti incumbency against BJP‚Ä¶and dont see them losing seats significantly (If any)

As much as I want the current government to change, im mentally prepared for the worst and hoping for the best.

The worst is that BJP will repeat its 2019 result (peak BJP moment) which is still unlikely given that farmers, unemployed youth and poor people who make up large part of rural electorate seem upset.. BJP traditionally gets more Urban votes than Rural, whereas congress gets more of its votes from Rural people and significantly lower urban voters

One of the major factors of voting psychology is that its not just the past performance that is judged, but also who is likely to solve their problems if elected and this perception is largely in favour of Modi. A lot of people still believe that Modi will solve their problems even if he hasn‚Äôt been able to do so in the past 10 years.

They will vote for someone who gives them hope.

Even assuming all these Problems will make a dent, but this is unlikely to bring them below 272..Why? Because BJP has big margin, and all these issues will eat into their huge margin And reduce their vote share but not their seat share.

Best case scenario would be BJP below 272 (around 250-260), at this point they would be dependent on their allies and they wont be as authoritarian as they are today and it wont be two man show (modi shah)

But thats just me, I dont find significant anti incumbency..in short there will be turbulence for the BJP but not enough to injure them..",652,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1crlwfp/why_is_social_media_reddittwitter_hyping_that_bjp/,1crlwfp,408.0,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1crlwfp/why_is_social_media_reddittwitter_hyping_that_bjp/,2024-05-14 12:27:55

Telling everyone I voted for BJP,"
I voted for the first-time today. I was really excited for it and was looking forward to today since past 1 month.

But ever since I left my house today for voting, there was this unsaid pressure from everyone around me to vote for Modi.

* First, it was my landlady who felt guilty for not taking me along with her to vote. so she called her friend who was volunteering at the colony polling booth to come and pick me up for casting my vote. After her friend came to pick me up, she called me to ask that I should go downstairs as her friend is waiting and towards the end she says - 'tu toh BJP wali hi hai na, BJP ko hi vote degi na .. modi ko hi dena vote' and i said haan haan because i was like she is only calling her friend to help me in voting
* Second, the lady who comes to pick me up tells me who she supported (BJP) and ""jaisa sab kuch chal rha hai, modi ke alawa kisi aur ko vote "".. so when she specifically asks me whom will i vote for .. i say unhiko.. bjp ... because now i am like she is doing so much to help me, i don wanna offend her or something.. and then she is taking care of my bag containing phone and laptop as i go to vote
* Third, in the polling booth line i came across an aunty from my society who i often meet on night walks and she converses with me (more like long monologues from her only and i only contribute like namaste haanji, etc)... when i walk out after voting, as she was still in the line after me and she stops me and asks me in front of others around her (gen-z group was standing around her) .. and says 'main ummeed krti hu ke tune sahi jagah hi vote dala hoga' .. i say 'haan haan, mujhe pta hai aap kinke saath align krte ho' (little background here - in her monologues to me on walk, she has told me that 'modi toh bhagwaan ka roop hai, wohi bacha sakta hai ab desh ko'... then she leans into me and asks 'modi ko diya na?' and i again say 'haan haan'.. and then i leave from there giving my greeting for the day and saying bye

Ever since then, i have been ruminating that was i wrong or right in just agreeing that i voted for them? the truth ofcourse is that i didnt vote for BJP (I WOULD NEVER EVER DO THAT)

**You see I am just sick and tired of telling BBs (BJP Bhakts) my actual opinion .. I dont have a problem in owning up to my opinions, however, the trouble with telling BBs you true opinion is that they take it so very fuckin personally.. they feel like they have been betrayed or whateva.. then they just make you stop and lecture and expect you to get convinced by them.. I have had long fights in the past with my own mother and father on how i do not support BJP and their politics.. and it gets so fucking toxic after a point and time.. They lose logic mid-conversation and that just irks me so so so much.. ever since those fights i have had with my family and family friends of that senior age group (40+ and all these aunties today whom I met were also of the same age group).. I have realised that there is really no point in putting my EFFORT and TIME and LOGIC for a conversation like that because I exactly know where it will end... I had done that for last so many years of my life... but now, i just dont wanna fight for my opinion because nobody in that age group agrees to disagree, instead they start hating you lowkey and judging you on every small aspect and thing... and they themselves start acting like the bond/ relationship I have with them is soured.. I really dont want to ruin my relationship with anyone around me and for that reason i was afraid to state the truth today.. but now after all that, I am feeling like a coward... Never knew my first voting experience would end up being so shitty that i start ruminating over my own character**

Not sure is y'all will understand me or judge me... but i didnt know where else i could put it out.. thus, im here. thanks for listening y'all <3",891,delhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1d0b6ps/telling_everyone_i_voted_for_bjp/,1d0b6ps,684.0,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1d0b6ps/telling_everyone_i_voted_for_bjp/,2024-05-25 18:12:00

Thinking about next 5 years if BJP wins is scary and horrifying. ,"
Some of the promises they have made in their manifesto seem like the final blow and nail in the coffin to Indian Democracy.

**1. One nation one election, under the garb of saving costs will deal a deathly blow to our Democracy which is already in ICU.**

>1. Dilution of Regional Issues: State elections often focus on specific regional concerns, and combining them with national elections could overshadow these crucial matters

>2. Reduced Accountability: Longer election cycles may reduce the frequency at which voters can hold governments accountable for their actions, potentially leading to complacency among elected representatives

>>>*1. When elections are staggered and spread across, it atleast keeps the national/multi-state parties on their toes and keeps them somewhat accountable and also allows for other states‚Äô issues/national issues to affect state elections.*

>>>2.*For example : Say a massive farmers protest occurs in Delhi and their ill treatment might influence voting decision of farmers in local states that are going to elections in the following months or a big corruption scandal that got exposed nationally might affect the same party‚Äôs prospects in the local elections.*

>>3. The constitutional challenges of ""One Nation One Election"" intensify if a government is dissolved or dismissed prematurely. This scenario raises complex issues regarding synchronizing the terms of the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies, requiring amendments to Articles 83, 85, 172, 174, and 356 of the Constitution. The need to manage breaks due to dissolution, President's Rule, or hung assemblies poses significant hurdles, potentially undermining India's federal structure. Without proper synchronization and constitutional amendments, the proposal risks facing legal and structural criticisms, impacting the democratic fabric of the country.

2.**UCC**

>1. UCC and Some sections of the new criminal laws are outright anti people and snatch away our freedoms. Like UCC requiring live in relationships registration and requiring scrutiny/consent from a police station guy, maintaining registry, and then after breakup
 
>>2. **Anti-Woman and Anti-Democratic (Anti-Liberty and State interference in personal lives):** The UCC is seen as anti-woman, anti-democratic, and draconian. It restricts adult women's sexual autonomy, allows for moral policing, and interferes in consensual relationships, including marriage and divorce

>3.**Criminalization and Penalties**: The UCC is criticized for its heavy focus on penalties and punishment, creating a legal environment that criminalizes personal choices and relationships.

>4 **Exclusion of Tribes and Targeting Minorities**: Critics highlight the exclusion of Scheduled Tribes (STs) from the UCC and its perceived targeting of Muslims. The law is viewed as a ""Hindu Code"" that imposes cultural values on all citizens, especially minorities

> 5.**Registration of Live-In Relationships**: Mandatory registration of live-in relationships is seen as intrusive, violating individual autonomy, and potentially leading to marital disputes, interference from authorities, and societal scrutiny

>6. **Selective Application and Double Standards:** Critics argue that the UCC's selective application, exemptions for certain communities, and exclusion of tribal and minority groups undermine the law's claim to uniformity and equality

>7. These criticisms collectively paint a picture of a UCC in Uttarakhand that is perceived as regressive, discriminatory, and detrimental to personal freedoms, especially in the context of relationships and breakups.

**And then if BJP wins this time with almost similar results as 2019 and in worst case if it gains more seats, then it reinforces BJP‚Äôs mindset , attitude and gives them bold confidence that what they are doing does not matter to people**

3. Manipur does not matter. They can get away with gross incompetence.
   
>1. *In any half decent democracy, this alone would be enough for a president‚Äôs rule to be enforced and state govt dismissed and army brought in.*

4.**Protests mean nothing to this govt and are dealt with force.**

>*1. Farmers protest took over a year with 700+ deaths and we all saw how the recent farmer protests were treated almost as an infiltration into the country with nails,spikes, blockages etc*

>2.*Wrestlers protest and nothing happened*

>*3. Ladakh Protest*

>4. Not attending and not even acknowledging the protests and meeting the agitated is basic responsibility of a govt. Whether the demands are reasonable/feasible/logical or not is secondary. If govt believes they are unreasonable then govt should atleast meet them and explain and sort things out.*

5. Extreme Misuse of agencies does not matter.

6. Press freedom does not matter. PM holding an open press conference and being held accountable does not matter. PM coming to the the parliament and answering questions does not matter.

7. Passing bills without any discussion or debate does not matter

8. Suspending MPs for raising their voice does not matter, Mass suspension also does not matter

9. Use of governors to interfere in state govts functioning does not matter

10. Washing machine politics does not matter. People dont care

11. Communalism and Hate speech does not matter

12. Toppling govts doesnt matter

13. Election Commission and its discharge of constitutional duties does not matter

14. Using PMLA and UAPA on civil society activists does not matter

15. Electoral bonds does not matter
16. Covid mishandling does not matter

17. Weakening of democracy does not matter. CAG / RTI is being diluted..

18. Heck, rejecting opposition candidates‚Äô nominations, forcing them to withdraw and win uncontested without even a single vote being cast like it happened in Indore,Surat and In Arunachal Pradesh, 10 BJP MLAs have been declared elected unopposed (they have simultaneous assembly and lok sabha elections)

19. I also have a distant fear that once NRC is brought in and implemented, Muslims might be particularly at the receiving end and a significant number of them might be declared as infiltrators. I dont know why I feel this , but I feel this more so after PM gave a blatant hate speech saying Muslims are those who have more kids and are infiltrators‚Ä¶

20. Delimitation if not done properly will make the south politically irrelevant because UP + Bihar will have equal political influence of that of the entire south.

21. Add above delimitation and the way they undermine Rajya Sabha by bypassing bills by introducing them as money bills to bypass rajya sabha scrutiny, further reduces the states political power in the federal structure.

The list is endless and these are some of the major things that come to my mind and are certainly gloomy.

I seriously don‚Äôt have energy to fight the whataboutery and falsehoods spread about the INDIA Alliance..

Remember in India politics is not who is good and better than the other but rather who is the lesser evil‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs clear who the lesser evil is.

Amazing how People are willing to trade humanity, empathy and their freedoms/liberties/privacy, democracy, social harmony for infrastructure. 

Its highly likely that BJP will return to power for 3rd term on their own. As much as I don‚Äôt want BJP to return , I‚Äôm starting to lose hope and I‚Äôm starting to believe in what Bhakts say , ‚ÄúAyega toh modi hi‚Äù ,

So be mentally prepared (atleast I am)‚Ä¶ Good luck and best wishes to all of us.

BJP and it's chokehold,"How did BJP come to power and take such a strong hold?

1. Constantly spewing hate:
Before 2014 have you ever given a thought about your friend's religion? We all have Azhar, Mohammed, John and Antony as friends but I'm sure none of us had any thought about their religion before 2014 and we knew them just as one of us.
But after 2014 through constant hate speech and fake news, the BJP has successfully made the breach and made that thought creep into people's subconscious. It's not serious, but you hear a name and think ""Ok he's a Muslim"". That's enough for them to rule us.


2. Overdose of propaganda movies:
We have 12 months a year but you can see atleast 15 movies coming out based on the Army. They want people to constantly feel proud of the Army and the nation to the point that even an Army veteran becomes a ""foreign aided christian missionary"" if he speaks out his grievances.
Needless to mention the countless other mainstream (even mass masala) movies that constantly glorify Hindu gods.


3. IT cell:
The BJP IT cell has the World's most disgusting human beings ever. They have a daily task of spreading fake news for every region, that has led to communal violence, riots and even murders. They have a separate group of people who work solely on defaming the opposition leaders, and an army of morons who relentlessly make personal attacks on people on social media who criticise them.


4. Puppet media:
You can see a news that the chief of security confessed he was forced to keep quiet about security shorcomings on a terrorist attacks, and see that news fade away like it's nothing. On the other hand, a small muslim shopkeeper could be trending for a week for no reason. 

The BJP literally OWN the country's media and they control what's on the news. Print, news and social media all. They promote hyper nationalism and themselves and don't let any negatives become huge.
They used the media to make Rahul Gandhi Pappu and still using it to trivialize leaders.


5. YouTube channels:
There are numerous channels on YouTube that are either on their paycheck or a born Hindu radicalist. They make regular content on hate and Islamophobia. There's even a channel that creates fake history in their favour!


6. Having people in power:
Now this is a tricky thing. Most people in power - be in media or the government happen to be the higher caste ones. I'm not here to discuss how they got the position. But these are the ones that have a natural affiliation towards the BJP because they look at them as their representation when the majority of the country hates them for the way this community has oppressed the others. These people have their full backing to the government that it becomes impossible to resist them.


7. The ""God saviour"" facade and fear mongering:
They promote themselves as saviours of Hinduism and they're trying to bring the glory back and all. They create an image that they are here to save our gods from the evil muslims and christians. But in reality they still discriminate people when it comes to the gods.

They constantly create fear among the people that Islam is terrorism and muslims are evil and so on. This is just to flock the Hindus together and milk them for votes. They've blamed Pakistan for anything and everything to the point that, people actually think Pakistan as a bigger threat than China. Whereas in reality Pakistan is nothing in terms of economy and military compared to India but China is a giant one. They cover up the Chinese occupying our land by creating a fake terrorist attack and Ji heroically saving us with a masterstroke.
Pakistan is blamed so much, that cricket fans give them more importance than Australia or England that are actually as strong as India.

TLDR; BJP have the advantage that people are God fearing. They create hatred, promote propaganda movies, control all media, has an IT cell full of goondas so it's going to take a substantial effort to dethrone them.",246,unitedstatesofindia,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedstatesofindia/comments/19e4uhf/bjp_and_its_chokehold/,19e4uhf,290.0,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedstatesofindia/comments/19e4uhf/bjp_and_its_chokehold/,2024-01-24 06:51:27

"BJP will win the 2024 elections, all us of know it, BUT...","# What if you don't vote?

Hi, I've been talking to a lot of people recently, and lots of people don't want to cast their vote because many of them believe that the BJP will again win the 2024 election. Why they'll win is entirely a question in itself. They could influence just before elections (I will be doing a separate post on this). They could rig the elections, \[links at bottom\], and some other reasons too. But what if something happens, and none of their cards worked, and they solely win because the ones who would have voted for them were sleeping at home, chilling at some cafe, masturbating to porn... The last one is fine, and you can still cast your vote after doing your deed, unless you go extreme and do it for 11 hours straight (7 am - 6 PM). In that case, seek help... 

Imagine how you would feel to be that person, and I'm not just talking to one of you, I'm talking to thousands/millions of you who would make that collective ONE. ONE who's against BJP, against fascism, against murders, against lynching, against terrorists and rapists in the Indian Parliament (be it any party).

# Why should you vote?

As for the first-time voters, don't listen to whatever the F your elders are telling you. ""Humne toh kara vote, aaega toh Modi hi"" and all kinds of crap. You cast your vote and leave the rest to Murphy's Law.

If you plan to sit at home just because you already know the results, I would like to remind you of something that a wise guy said. Let's say BJP will win in the 2024 elections, but ""Not all battles are fought for victory. Some are fought to tell the world that someone was there on the battlefield.""

# What happens if you vote?

""HYPOTHETICALLY,"" Let's suppose that the BJP is gonna win the 2024 elections. It wins in a constituency with a lead of 50k votes. What if thousands/millions of you choose to vote? Well, now maybe BJP wins only with a 5k lead. It changes nothing, right? RIGHT? WRONG!

It will give the future generation HOPE. Instead of 50k, they have to only think, ""Oh, it was a close call last time, I should also cast my vote, maybe we win (BJP loses) this time, maybe BJP loses with 50k votes in every constituency."" Seems impossible, right? Well, someone said ""I have a dream"" in 1963. It worked for him...

If you have seen Shawshank Redemption, there were 2 quotes regarding hope:

1. ""Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane.‚Äù
2. ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.""

Pick the one you like and act accordingly. We all know how that movie ended, and an alternative would have SUCKED. (Green Mile)

# If you still do not wish to vote...

As for the people who strictly don't want to cast their vote just because they're upper class or belong to a certain category, caste, or religion, therefore it won't matter to them. Well, you enjoy your privilege, while you can...

Don't think that your home is not on fire. Why should you care? Fire will catch up eventually, but no one will be there left to help you, and you might have been dealt the worst hand possible because you won't even have a shoulder to cry on or people to ask for help. Good luck with that.

As to the people who are not gonna vote solely for the reason that they think they're just too cool for this, I just want to tell them, >!""Bhakk Bh##%$\*d""!<

One more BJP term = Nazi Germany ü§£ü§£ü§£,"I recently spoke to a Pentecostal Christian friend in Chennai who sincerely believes that he's safe and alive only because Stalin and DMK are in power. All the lambs of his church believe that too. He wants to vote out BJP at any cost as he shudders at the thought of another BJP term. The thought of BJP getting seats in TN gives him the shivers.Even now, he's expecting Modi's RSS goons to show up at his door any moment and murder his family because they are Christians. Just like Nazi Germany. He's been expecting it since 2014. Now he's trying with all his might to migrate to Canada before he and family are killed. He atleast wants to get his wife and kids safely abroad even if he can't make it.

Is BJP still winning the election after all this?,"

These are ongoing events by BJP:

- Treating farmers' protest like terrorism, raising barricades to block them, resulting in several deaths, despite the protest being a fundamental right of citizens.

- Freezing Congress bank accounts right before elections.

- Arresting Arvind Kejriwal and various opposition leaders to eliminate competition.

- Involvement in the electoral bond scam with a clear pattern of quid pro quo.

Despite these concerns, there seems to be a clear consensus that BJP is winning the election. A country cannot be in a more pitiful state than when an evidently corrupt party with fascist tendencies is poised to win the election.",255,unitedstatesofindia,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedstatesofindia/comments/1bkejc0/is_bjp_still_winning_the_election_after_all_this/,1bkejc0,297.0,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedstatesofindia/comments/1bkejc0/is_bjp_still_winning_the_election_after_all_this/,2024-03-22 00:35:57

Why INDIA bloc / Congress is better than bjp any day. ,"You can¬†**hold them accountable**, that's it. I don't mean voting for someone else next time I mean what the¬†**farmers protests**¬†did and what the truckers did. Unlike against bj party and mudi, with congress it will be easier and faster. The UPA was brought down by the people once and the people had the support or at least the media reporting of the protests

It isn't congress it is¬†**INDIA**. We have already seen them criticize each other and call out their bad moves, people call it bad for the alliance but it is good for us, just like a coalition govt. Recently in the Rohith vemula case the¬†**congress govt reopened the case due to backlash** from the public.

With bj party in the opposition they won't shut up either. Unlike bj party the¬†**congress doesn't have a vice grip on media**¬†and with internet and social media the govt can be held accountable to a higher level, not with bj party because of godi media but it is easier with congress.

BJP will NOT sweep the Indian elections. Detailed Analysis.,"The following evaluation is result of a constructive exchange between u/TrueSonOfNoOne (from north India) and myself (from south) on USI. This state wise scrutiny is divided in 2 sections - section 1 is u/TrueSonOfNoOne's assessment of north & west India and section 2 is my response to it, for south & east. Please share your inputs from your respective states.

# Section 1

**Bihar:** Biharis don't like NK due to his constant flip flopping. Imo if the BJP contested in Bihar with their own face instead of stealing Nitish Kumar then they'd win. But because of the horse trading, they'll prolly lose to RJD since that party is seen as more consistant and hasn't gone through the ""Paltu ram"" life that JDU has. Even though RJD was corrupt, at the very least they weren't collapsing the government every time they were scared of losing. Unless Bihar gets a third option, it'll flip flop between RJD and JDU and right now it'll flop to RJD due to NK's presence in JDU. BJP has not been able to get an independent face in Bihar, even their rallies haven‚Äôt gathered much crowds in comparison to the opposition‚Äôs. I‚Äôd honestly say this goes to INDIA alliance, or if nothing else JDU is gonna get squashed by RJD.

**MH:** Marathis are generally pissed at the horse trading and splitting of SS and NCP which has caused gang violence to pop up at a higher rate (see the shooting of a SS UBT MLA on facebook live and subsequent killing of the assassin as an example). At the same time, a lot of the MLAs that people like were taken by Eknath Shinde and amongst some Marathas, people like eknath more because he is seen more as a successor to the hindutva/maratha identity. Overall I‚Äôd call this a swing state a la Chhattisgarh, could go either way.

**UP** isn't the bhagwadhari fuck fest everyone makes it out to be. I'm from there originally (though have lived in US for much longer now), my family still lives there and even though I'm not there anymore I still talk to people who live there and tell me what's up. From people in villages to Noida. The BJP here played the Ram Mandir card way too early because a week later people stopped giving a damn about that and the ""Kashi-Mathura Baaqi Hai"" craze died off in a week. What people are talking about is the farmer's protest in western UP, RLD's exit from SP+ and the exam leaks in Purvanchal and Awadh. First the UPPSC exams leaked now the lawyer exams are leaking. RLD's exit is more of a loss for RLD and NDA than it is for INDIA, Jatts feel betrayed due to Jayant Chaudhary falling in with the party which literally beat him in the street during the farmer's protest. He'll be bleeding support. This plus lack of closure for the Lakhimpur murder, MBC MLAs going from BJP to SP+ to the recent events with the exams leads me to believe that the BJP will tank some hits but it won't be what will make them lose. Expect the 2024 LS result to mirror the 2022 VS result for UP, with about 30%-35% or so going to Samajwadi+ and the rest going to NDA. 25% if things get bad, 40% if a miracle happens. Majority will still be NDA, but the magnitude by which NDA wins will matter.

One thing to note is that the BJP's share of winning in UP elections has decreased over time.

In 2014 LS BJP won 71/80 seats. Strike rate of about 90%.

\-13%

In 2017 VS BJP won 312/403 seats. Strike rate of about 77%.

\+1%

In 2019 LS BJP won 62/80 seats. Strike rate of about 78%.

\-13%

In 2022 VS BJP won 255/403 seats. Strike rate of about 63%.

63% is not a landslide victory. 2014 yes I can argue is, but the BJP has been dropping in popularity pretty consistently. I even remember people were chucking black ink at them during the election [(Link)](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/black-ink-attack-on-bjp-s-obc-candidate-in-ghosi-bypoll-heightens-political-tensions-sp-and-bjp-blame-each-other-101692552015099.html).

BJP also straight up chucked bombs in [Etawah](https://theprint.in/india/sir-i-have-been-slapped-bjp-workers-have-bombs-asp-heard-saying-in-viral-up-poll-violence-video/693972/) district. And yes most of the Etawah district MLAs are SP+. Granted Etawah is a traditional SP district so not much to mention here.

My family is from the Lakhimpur/Sitapur area and fwiw there's a couple reasons why Lakhimpur didn't immediately flip.

1. A lot of the protesting farmers were just not local to the area. Punjabis migrated to the Terai a while ago and started farming in the area. So people weren't super connected with them. The guy who ran them over though, was a local MLA so even that guy had supporters from the Tyagi/Brahmin peoples. People overall weren't a huge fan of Punjabis buying up land to farm there.
2. The main castes of the area are Teli, Kurmi, Rajbhar and Pasi. Teli, Kurmi, Pasi were heavily campaigned to by the BJP. OP Rajbhar was flip flopping at this time, he went with SP. Gaderiya people are also common in Lakhimpur but generally they vote either way. People also still associated the SP with Yadav Raj and didn't want to return to that so they voted against SP.
3. Basic infra push to the villages, no explanation needed there.

Despite that where do you see a landslide victory here for the state of UP? At least regarding its most recent election.

https://preview.redd.it/0jfoo7xv2tpc1.jpg?width=320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c921a65bf30b498a29f18616c00a7af2f599472

The vote share increased by about 2% yes. But the seat share decreased by 57 seats.

Why?

Because a lot of BJP's hindutvadi antics mostly pander to more urbanized voters. Obviously they have rural appeal as well, but much of their rural appeal comes from castes they've already campaigned to heavily (Teli, Lodh, Kurmi, Pasi, Nishad for example) and also having infrastructure push to more rural areas. For rural voters, it isn't pure hindutva that makes them go BJP. Obviously yes a good number of bhakts are rural (otherwise BJP wouldn't win shit), but I'd argue a lot of online chaddis you see live in tier 2 cities or Noida. That's where much of the vote increase happened, it wasn't spread all to the rural areas as much as they'd hope and this map is proof of that.

[This was the exit btw.](https://theprint.in/politics/10-up-mlas-ministers-quitting-raises-questions-about-bjp-import-policy-at-cost-of-loyalists/802984/) This is what helped SP out in the election in 2022. Other MBC MLAs like Rakesh Rathore have also left the BJP.

I didn't pull the possible ""30-35% will be SP+ the rest will be BJP"" claim out of nowhere, I was basing it off of the last VS election in UP.

The farmer protest were always more concentrated in western UP if I'm being honest and even if it isn't the same level of intensity as before, it is still a factor in how a lot of people think. RLD got way more popular in NW UP off of the farmer protest and Jayant Chaudhary got the shit beaten out of him by the BJP. Now after an award to his grandfather he flips? That's gonna cost him seats and votes in the eyes of a lot of people in the farmer's movement.

**MP, Gujarat and Rajasthan** are all gonna be BJP most likely, nothing going on there which could change that in my eyes.

**Chhatisgarh** could be a win for the opposition namely because right after the BJP got voted into power in CT, the forest destruction of Bastar started to increase by a lot. Bhupesh Baghel has had corrupt nonsense with him regarding the gambling app, but he was a good CM in many people's eyes and did help with many programs for the common people. This current CM of Chattisgarh is only really known for letting Bastar get more fucked up and trying to introduce stupid hindu muslim nonsense into a mostly tribal area of the state (Kanker). Imo I'd be surprised if the BJP steals a win here after they fumbled their last win. The Jashpur royal is with BJP, Surguja is with INC and Modi's caste (Teli) is pretty strong in CT. On the basis of Bhupesh Baghel's better performance compared to Vishnu Deo Sai's performance, the forest destruction, Teli‚Äôs being a big caste in Chhattisgarh and the Jashpur vs Surguja royal rumble, I‚Äôd say its a swing state.

**Jharkhand** is interesting in that the BJP tried to collapse the gov't by arresting Hemant Soren. Champai got installed in his place and he's rallied a lot of the Adivasi population behind him. Yes Hemant is corrupt, so is everyone and frankly JMM has a loyal voting bloc with mainly Adivasis and some Diku castes. At the same time a lot of people are frustrated with the JMM admin so its hard to decide. Jharkhand has 5 districts which I could say are ‚Äúswing districts‚Äù. And with Champai Soren being Chief Minister now, he may win the Jamshedpur district for Lok Sabha. I‚Äôd call this as a NDA dominated state with 2-5 districts going to INDIA.

**NW India (Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Himachal, J&K):** Mostly gonna be INDIA alliance, biggest flip will be Haryana. Brij Bhushan, farmer protest, khap panchayats going against the BJP, Jatt votebank, Aam Aadmi's presence, UCC implementation fucking with random couples, Ankita Bhandari's murder, 370 in J&K. Too much to name, generally expect little to no seats for the BJP here except for Uttarakhand. And even then I'm not sure how far that'll go due to UCC and the Bhandari murder. So safely this region will be INDIA alliance.

**NE India (7 sister states + Sikkim):** anti CAA protests, Manipur drama spilling into other states, threatening to fence off the Burmese border. All of this is saying that expect a loss for the NDA here except Assam, Tripura and Manipur. Tripura will stay NDA due to border issues with BD, Manipur will go NDA and Biswa Sarma still holds a lotta sway in the state but the anti CAA protests with Modi's effigy literally being set on fire says a lot different. Assam will bleed seats but idk if it'll be enough to throw out the BJP.

**West Bengal** is a tricky one. TMC has an iron grip on everything there but Sandeshkhali has been handled badly and the BJP is a growing presence there. Expect TMC win with a BJP opposition.

# Section 2

Section 1 essentially gave Bihar, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal, Kashmir, all NE (except Assam, Tripura and Manipur), WB and even 30% of seats in UP to INDIA. With MH and Chhatisgarh being swing states.

Let's add up the seats in these states. **For a conservative estimate,** let's add up only half the seats in these states for INDIA. That is, Bihar (20), MH (24), Chhatisgarh (6), Haryana (5), Himachal (2), Kashmir (3), NE ( Arunachal 1, Meghalaya 1, 1 seat from both Mizo and Nagaland. Total 3 from NE), UP (30% of 80 = 24). This totals to 87.

In the south and east, BJP already has only 55 seats out of 195. Tally from last elections below -

Kerala 20 (total seats) - 0 (BJP won)

Lakshadweep 1 - 0

TN 39 - 0

Puducherry 1 - 0

Andaman 1 - 0

Andhra 25 - 0

Karnataka 28 - 25

Telangana 17 - 4

Orissa 21 - 8

WB 42-18

Total 195 - 55

Along with these 140 seats in south and east plus Punjab is close to 150 seats in itself for INDIA. Add to this the 87 (remember this number is a very conservative estimate by u/TrueSonOfNoOne's own admission). Which means **INDIA needs only 35 seats** combined from MP, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Assam, Manipur, Tripura, Delhi, Goa to prevent a BJP majority. For MP and Rajasthan, Yogendra Yadav already analyzed BJP is losing seats [https://thewire.in/politics/bjp-assembly-elections-hat-trick-2024](https://thewire.in/politics/bjp-assembly-elections-hat-trick-2024) if the voting pattern for their recent VS election end up being somewhat similar.

In Delhi (and Maharashtra, UP), unlike last time, opposition has been able to put up joint candidates which means they will not split INDIA votes and it's a direct one to one fight with BJP. Remember even at it's peak, BJP had only 38% of the vote share across the country which means 62% aren't voting for it. The moment opposition is able to put up joint candidates, this math comes into play where the opposition votes aren't getting split thereby not giving BJP an advantage.

For Assam and Manipur, I differ slightly with section 1's estimate. I think CAA protest in Assam and the ethnic cleansing in Manipur will have bigger negative impact on NDA than predicted in section 1.

**RSS/BJP already knows this math and that they are falling short of a majority.** Hence the infighting has started within the party \[CAG's report on Dwaraka Expressway is evidence of this [https://scroll.in/article/1054771/what-cags-indictment-of-nitin-gadkaris-ministry-signals](https://scroll.in/article/1054771/what-cags-indictment-of-nitin-gadkaris-ministry-signals)\]. Which also explains the heavy propaganda they are running about 400 par, hat-trick etc to make voters think they are winning and getting ppl to vote for the apparent winner. Also look at the campaign trips Modi-Shah duo are making - it's consistently to the south to make up for the loss of seats in their traditional N&W belt. Chief ministers are getting arrested and opposition bank accounts are getting frozen.

Democracy and Free and Fair elections? Anyone?

Now some typical BJP Bhakts will do whataboutery and say what about Emergency, what about booth capturing in pre-2000 era etc etc 

Amazing how People are willing to trade humanity, empathy and their freedoms/liberties/privacy, democracy, social harmony for infrastructure.

No whataboutism please, all these things (minus infra) were far better in were far better in UPA era.

Even if for a moment we give the benefit of doubt to those who support BJP and accept their argument or stance, **whats the guarantee that BJP would continue infrastructure push when they become authoritarian?**

And infra doesn‚Äôt mean only roads, airports, ports. It also means clean air, environment, accessible spaces, SMART CITIES (remember?) , etc

And this infrastructure image that BJP has has its own fair share of corruption so BJP Supporters cannot claim they are clean (all are equally dirty in corruption, none spared) , and has its own quality problems, toll prices problems, monopolisation problems. So the reason why BJP came to power in 2014 was riding the India against Corruption movement.. now that differentiating factor of non corrupt vs corrupt has vanished.. whats left?  And something as recent as Electoral bonds, Washing Machine to reinforce this point.

Even if you assume both congress and BJP are equally corrupt and deliver equal economic performance, congress atleast has better social fabric and democratic values. See their manifesto if you haven‚Äôt.

Economy? Most of the economic growth is because of the govt spending and we all see the joblessness and unemployment rates..If govt is really doing good then they should be talking about jobs and employment in the election rallies and propaganda‚Ä¶

But there are commendable positives like startups, digital economy

Do you think if this govt had created enough jobs during its tenure, they wouldn‚Äôt have made a huge campaign and drumbeating about it? 

This govt celebrates even the smallest of things like the biggest of things ‚Ä¶

What about religious hatred that is being spread and whats the point of all the wealth or infrastructure if you dont have social harmony in the country and have riots like scenario?

Whats the point of all the development when you dont have basic freedoms to eat wear love marry according to your choice..

Like many have pointed out, the trajectory this govt is on would end up being a banana republic like china with dystopian human rights and liberties minus the infrastructure that china enjoys. (*this is the best they can do at  their best, assuming no corruption, rapid industrialisation, infrastructure, which is unrealistic, so we would end up with worst human rights and mediocre infrastructure*) 

If democracy is intact and breathing incompetence and flaws of govt can be exposed and made accountable,
Once you become authoritarian, what can anyone do even if you don‚Äôt do any infrastructure development? 

Even if you ignore allllllll these things just answer this question: 

**If the Modi Govt is doing sooooo good (whatever this good means to you) then why do they need to demolish democracy?

Wont they be re-elected anyways if they did such an amazing work that you some of you believe?   

Rig elections in broad daylight, Jail opponents, break parties, suppress freedom, suppress and control media, do all these nonsense religious hatred, pass bills without discussion debate, use money bills to bypass rajya sabha scrutiny, suspend opposition MPs enmasse etc

Amit Shah being ingenious ,"I recently saw a clip of Amit Shah's Q&A session with Rahul Kanwal in the India Today Conclave. The whole video is on youtube but I can't find the short version of it.

Anyways the context is, Rahul Gandhi recently claimed only 4 out 89 secretaries in the union govt
above the rank of joint secretary, were from backward classes. This is an undisputed fact. 

When the anchor Rahul Kanwal asked Shah about this, Shah said, ""the average age of a Joint Secretary(JS) is 52 years. This is Congress's mistake because it is they who didn't induct enough backward class officers in the past 50 years. This led to a very small talent pool of such officers to choose from. And now BJP is trying to rectify the situation.""

Everyone clapped and thought shah gave a witty reply. And Kanwal didnt ask a supplementary question. 

Now the issue is, Amit Shah was being disingenuous. Everyone thought he was talking about OBCs who were given the quote in 1993 and hence, they're too young to become JS now. 

But Rahul Gandhi was talking about SC/ST officers. There's only 1 SC secretary and 3 ST secretaries in the union govt currently. 

Congress can't be blamed for creating too small of a pool of SC/ST officers because the SC/ST quota has been in operation since independence. In fact, the last 10 years were the best times for induction of SC/ST officers since they would be among the first batches who were born and studied in independent India and entered the services in the 70s. 

Now there are multiple ways to look at it. Perhaps the perceived quality of SC/ST candidates was not upto expected levels. Possibly many candidates chose to stay in the state cadres and didn't want to get empanelled for the centre. 

Perhaps there are deep seated prejudices even at the highest levels against SC/ST officers and this justifies reservation in promotions. 

Also, this is all the more surprising because PM Modi has been passionate about dismantling the hemenony of IAS officers in the top posts of union govt. He started lateral entry, induction of officers from other series like IRS, IAAS to the Joint secretary posts etc. PM Modi could've easily figured a way out to fix the low representation of SC/STS.

My issue also stems from why Kanwal didnt ask a supplementary quesiton to Shah about this. This just lends credibility to the opposition claim that TV news media is just a BJP mouthpiece and doesn't ask difficult questions to the govt. 

Now before someone accuses me, I‚Äôm not from SC/ST/OBC and I‚Äôve been and will always be a staunch supporter of BJP. I‚Äôm even called a ‚Äúbhakt‚Äù by my friends and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a pejorative at all. If anything, it‚Äôs a badge of honour.
