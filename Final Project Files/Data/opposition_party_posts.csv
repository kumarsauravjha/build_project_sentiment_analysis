A political blunder from Indian National Congress? Or what? ,"The candidates for upcoming Lok Sabha election has been announced by INC yesterday. K. Muralidharan got shifted to Thrissur after a day long drama and he replaced T.N.Prathapan. Probably because INC decided to give BJP a reply after they roped in Padmaja. Murali is not a stranger to Thrissur and he will be challenge to both SG and V.S. Sunil kumar. So it not a bad move. But what happened in Palakkad and Alappuzha is quite interesting , atleast for me. None other than Shafi Parambil came into the scene. Shafi is already an MLA of Palakkad constituency. We all know what happened during 2021 elections in Palakkad. E. Sreedharan gave him a tough fight and at one point everybody thought that BJP would win. Shafi eventually won win a mere majority of 3859. He had a majority of 17483 in 2016. What if Shafi win against K.K.Shailaja ? Palakkad by-election will happen and BJP will be waiting.  E.Sreedharan might contest again and BJP will go all out to secure the seat they lost by a small margin in 2021. 

Next is Alappuzha, where AICC General Secretary K.C.Venugopal decides to contest. He is now a Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan and if he win he will have to vacate the seat. Now who will win that seat at the moment? The answer is BJP. Its pretty much like INC gifting a Rajya Sabha seat to BJP, if K.C becomes a LokSabha M.P. 

I really thought INC would field somebody like V.TBalram or T.Siddque in Vatakara and Rahul Mankoottathil in Alappuzha. K.K.Rama also would’ve been a great candidate against K.K.Shailaja at Vatakara. But they went with Shafi Parambil and K.C.Venugopal. Both Vatakara and Alappuzha are not strong holds for BJP and they are sure they wont win. Since UDF victories in both constituencies will eventually help BJP, I think crossvoting will happen in favour of UDF and that wont help LDF at all.",154,Kerala,https://i.redd.it/7cxx5a281anc1.jpeg,1badtml,144.0,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kerala/comments/1badtml/a_political_blunder_from_indian_national_congress/,2024-03-09 14:53:38
"If you’re Indian National Congress President, what would be your strategy to defeat Narendra Damodardas Modi in upcoming General Elections 2024?","When Rahul Gandhi was President of INC during the 2019 general elections, and after the massive defeat, he was trolled for his election manifesto and promises he made. Now for 2024 general elections, Kharge is INC’s President, but it can be assumed that Rahul Gandhi is calling the shots from the distance. He went on to take the “Bharat Jodo Yatra”, for which he was both loved and criticised. Now he is doing yet another “Nyay Yatra” to the run up of 2024 general elections.

I’ve read that many people are not sure how it’s gonna help INC to win against Narendra Modi who is riding high with a Ram Mandir flag in his hand and on a religious opium fed elephant.

Now no one is talking about the wilful negligence during Covid-19 and how it led to millions of deaths across India. Whatever opposition promises to give to the people if elected to power is now termed as “Muft ki Revadi”, but 80 crore people are being given free ration to get votes is not “Muft ki Revadi”.

So assume you are the President of INC and a Prime Ministerial candidate from the opposition to stand up and fight against Narendra Modi, what will you do to win especially knowing that all the institutions have been high-jacked by the BJP-RSS, and you as a party is also well short of funds in comparison to BJP’s bank balance to fund election campaigns, use Govt’s resources like transportation to carry people from one place to another, and full control over Media, which keeps on singing the praise day in day out.",83,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1augg5i/if_youre_indian_national_congress_president_what/,1augg5i,133.0,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1augg5i/if_youre_indian_national_congress_president_what/,2024-02-19 11:48:46

Why are there many Indian nationals Singapore's financial services sector?,"Before I get downvoted, please allow me to explain.

After being interviewed across small shops & family offices (buy-side and sell-side), I have discovered that the CEOs or managing directors hail from India and hire other Indian nationals for their mid-level management, with one or two local Singaporeans as juniors. 

It just seems as though they are bringing over their own people from overseas rather than hire local Singaporeans. 

I also found out that the government gave them & their families Singapore citizenship, where they send their kids to international schools here and to universities overseas (via LinkedIn & social media). Seriously though, where is the assimilation? They are clearly using Singapore as a stepping stone.

Does the government know that this is happening?

Hypothetical: Imagine that BJP ruled India after independence. Either we will be a Hindu Pakistan or a failed dictatorship like North Korea,"Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and Congress leaders such as Mahatama Gandhi,Jawaharlal Nehru, Bose Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel etc played pivotal roles in shaping modern India, especially during the crucial period around India's independence in 1947. Their efforts were instrumental in laying down the foundation of an independent, democratic India grounded in principles of justice and equality.

Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, as the principal architect of the Indian Constitution, worked tirelessly to ensure that the constitution safeguarded the rights of all citizens, especially the marginalized and underprivileged communities. His emphasis on social justice, equality, and the abolition of untouchability transformed the social fabric of India.

Leaders from the Congress party, notably Nehru, who became India's first Prime Minister, envisioned India as a secular, democratic state. Nehru's policies were focused on nation-building through industrialization, education, and scientific advancement. Sardar Patel, often referred to as the ""Iron Man of India,"" was crucial in integrating the numerous princely states into the Indian Union, ensuring a united and stable nation.

Stop obsessing over Indian girls and look for other nationalities. Real Experience!!!,"The amount of great girls out there from other countries is unmatched. They are much better in communication, replies, building a relationship. They do not give you one word replies or yes/no answers. If you are looking for pretty, intelligent girls who can hold conversations then seek other options and see the difference. In my personal experience I found them to be more worthy of dating. 

Whereas, most girls in India have reached to “TREAT ME LIKE A QUEEN” attitude even when they don’t put similar efforts, I said most not all of them. Dating apps are horrible because they have 500likes and matches by doing nothing. There’s no Equality, and we are the problem here. Do not put them on a fake pedestal.

A lot of INDIAN Girls are getting unprecedented levels of attention of loser men on the internet and that’s making them live in a fantasy world. Social Media has changed the game and they no longer have to put efforts, everything is getting served to them.

In blink of an eye they have 100 matches because they use filters, or a little body show and the amount of sexual aggression in our country is insane. Horny guys everywhere!! 
Stay away from girls who put their Instagram handle, that’s the biggest red flag and shows that she’s chasing clout.

Seriously, take time to build yourself and focus on self growth. Treat girls with respect but do not chase them like a thirsty deer. 


Just an advice and once again I am not generalising for all the females but this has been increasing a lot.
Give it a try and look for someone with similar interests. :)",209,onexindia,https://www.reddit.com/r/onexindia/comments/1c5cise/stop_obsessing_over_indian_girls_and_look_for/,1c5cise,167.0,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/onexindia/comments/1c5cise/stop_obsessing_over_indian_girls_and_look_for/,2024-04-16 15:44:55

National news and Congress writing campaign ,"My fellow veterans to all that have or even have not been service connected at a percentage or 0% connected - my quick story is I am service connected at 0% for leukemia but cannot get rated due to not receiving chemo yet due to my doctors choice of treatment, but was told if I die from it my wife can request compensation minimum of 30% from my death from it. The laws and rules of VA compensation and the PACT ACT are BROKEN! and sickening when the government gives so much away for free to non citizens and we are begging for penny’s and recognition of service connected for a long list of ailments. I am requesting all of you to please begin a new huge writing campaign to national news companies (There is currently a story on Fox about vets) your Senators and Representatives. I have been in contact with the IL State Rep and chair of the VA committee but I really have not much faith in real change for compensation rules and decisions — look how long the PACT ACT took and even that is super flawed.

Reddit Inc - RDDT,"Thought I might post this to provide some information.

Reddit is trying to go public at a a $6.4 billion valuation. They have negative shareholder's equity of $412.9 million and a loss in net income of $90.8 million.

Looking into this a bit deeper, there seems to be a lot of convertible preferred stock which is owned by some interesting key people. The preferred has some nuanced and special provisions that make it very favorable relative to the common stock that they are trying to sell to the public. The common stock that they are promoting is Class A stock, which has 1/10th the voting rights of Class B, of course with Class B being owned by insiders. They also have a ton of Class C stock that can massively dilute your ownership and can be issued without your vote. To me it seems like the main purpose for this IPO is to enrich two people at the expense of retail shareholders, these two people being Steven Huffman and Steven Newhouse. I think that it's unethical they are promoting this financial garbage to loyal Redditors and moderators, and I also think that Steven Huffman is a bad CEO. The company's financials and capital structure are both awful, and I wouldn't touch this stock with a ten foot pole.

Discord Inc is not your friend,"I've seen a lot of posts complaining about how Discord forces Nitro down your throat and I think it's time to give my two cents on this.

Discord Inc is not your friend. Discord Inc is a company, which, like every other company, only exists for the sake of making money for its shareholders, even if it involves screwing over the end user or its employees. If Discord Inc makes money, Discord Inc happy. Individuals at the company can be your friends, but the company itself is not your friend. Besides, a company's point of view is that all publicity is good publicity, especially if you're vocal about Discord requiring Nitro for certain features.

As I mentioned in my Gist about the username update, I mentioned about how the core experience will always be free, and how Nitro only really adds features to an already bountiful experience. Discord managed to go eight years without seeing an ad, and that's rather a milestone if you think about it. In fact, I can't even see how Discord can turn a profit. They pay for employees, hundreds of high quality voice servers, database servers and more. That's a lot of money to spend for a company that's providing a service for free. When you look at the reliable service that they provide, I don't think that a subscription service is that unreasonable. I mean, I could be wrong, but I can't see any reason why I should be.

In fact, you're lucky that they provide a better experience than Skype or Teamspeak, for free, so why acting entitled over a service that provides a strong experience for free is completely beyond me.",1180,discordapp,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/1cik0q5/discord_inc_is_not_your_friend/,1cik0q5,185.0,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/1cik0q5/discord_inc_is_not_your_friend/,2024-05-02 21:58:24

"FORGET ABOUT Ai THIS WEEK! Why Bumble, Inc. ($BMBL) Is Likely to Lose -25% by EOW","Hello fellow regards. I am well aware of the Ai hype that has gripped the wallets and anooses of gay bears and frothy bulls alike these past couple of weeks. However, press pause for just a moment on NBA 2k and listen to this guaranteed 5x trade that seriously cannot go tits up. I am going to provide a long analysis for the more intellectually inclined and will also provide a TL;DR with a position at the end for you impatient lissencephalic bastards.

**Thesis:** Bumble, Inc. ($BMBL) is going to be worth 1/4 less by the end of the week, because nobody is going to be loyal to a specific dating app and they have no path to continued exponential growth.

**Background:**

$BMBL IPO’d on Feb 11. 2021 at a share price of $43 dollars/share and a total IPO price of $2.2B valuation and closed that same day at roughly $70. Keep in mind that 2021 was punctuated with many private companies cashing out and going public at the height of the inflationary and volatile beginning to 2021 where we saw the “stock that shall not be named” get squeezed into oblivion. However, behind the scenes, companies like $BMBL took the opportunity to cash in on the “meme-stock” craze and fleece clueless “dumb-money” for all they are worth (aka: you).

Barely 7 months after their initial offering, $BMBL diluted their stock in order to raise money and pay off various liabilities. On Sept 15, 2021 $BMBL completed another set of offerings, this time offering 20 million shares at a price of roughly $54 dollars/share. Their last dilution took place last year on March 8, 2023 where they were able to raise roughly 160 million dollars by issuing 7.5 million shares at $22.80. Essentially, from the inception of this company as a publicly traded entity, dilutions and fundraisers have been the primary source of raising money. This is because....

$BMBL has a horrible product portfolio with no real competitive advantage. Of the four apps that are owned by the parent company Bumble, Inc. ($BMBL) makes up the bulk of their revenue with Badoo coming in a close second. The revenue from Fruitz and Official, their other applications, are not even included in the revenue as they are essentially negligible.

**Fundamentals:**

The current macro environment is not kind to companies that are priced for exponential growth and lose money. Also, greed is at an all time high, but not for dating app companies that are **trying to sell themselves as a tech company** that focuses on dating.

&#x200B;

[Fear and Greed Index](https://preview.redd.it/pvnydxo9oxkc1.jpg?width=846&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=737d3c347289ff219e96359089e0ef5c397f282a)

**Quantitative:**

Bumble, Inc. is the parent company to four different apps: Bumble, Badoo, Official, and Fruitz. All of these apps are centered around dating, with $BMBL being the most popular of the four and Badoo coming in at a close second. As of their last quarterly report, between the four apps, $BMBL is reporting a paid user base of roughly 3.7 million users which is a 600 million increase from the year prior. Also, they have increased their revenue to $778 million which is up from $661 million the year prior, a 15% increase.

This all sounds like good news, right? **WRONG!!!** Their increases in revenue are still coming on the heels of **millions of dollars in losses**. In the 9 months ended Sept of 2022, $BMBL had a net loss of 45 million dollars. However, they ended the year in Dec 2022 with a total **loss of $114 million** when it was all said and done. In the 9 months ending Sept 2023, $BMBL reported a loss of only 30 million. This is not entirely true as stock dilutions and offerings are blunting the true effect of their losses and even if it is, they managed to increase revenue by over $100 million dollars from the year prior and are still posting a loss. Unfortunately, the macroenvironment is no longer kind to companies that are priced for growth on huge mountains of debt and constant financing through dilutions. This year, I speculate that they will also have a major loss, as they typically use accounting strategies to obfuscate their true losses until the fully audited 10K is released, which is Tuesday after market close.

**Qualitative:**

In February of 2021, then CEO of $BMBL ,Whitney Wolfe Herd, was being heralded as a genius entrepreneur and as one of the youngest and only “self-made” female billionaires.

&#x200B;

[$BMBL ex CEO \/ GILF](https://preview.redd.it/qodh7u0eoxkc1.jpg?width=829&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26f20a77c2569d4ae95dfd954c328ceab026504a)

However, in the Fall of 2023, less than 3 years after $BMBL ‘s IPO, she had to step down after poor performance and was replaced by Lidiane Jones, another tech executive who was previously in charge of the workplace communication service, Slack. This can also be translated to, the last three months of 2023 had $BMBL executives and staff mainly focused on bureaucratic positional maneuverings rather than the top and bottom line of the company.

**Options Chain:**

Now, I know what you may be thinking. MoneyCloudOps, bad earnings and bad leadership isnt enough to predict a major leg down on a stock in this fucking clown market. Normally, you would be right. However, there is even greater evidence that is compelling for a major leg down on $BMBL this week: **The Options Chain.**

The open interest and options skew on the chain for ($BMBL) this month is absolutely asinine. To the point where it may be possible that someone has insider information on a major earning’s miss and is positioning themselves for major gains. The following images are screenshots taken from barchart detailing the unbelievable put skew currently on these options.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. March 22nd Options Chain: 631.54 put/call ratio....yes that is not a typo.

&#x200B;

[The Options Chain that forced me to make this post](https://preview.redd.it/8tjxjywxoxkc1.jpg?width=1031&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e93d5eee90257b1aaf0072d12d0b456f65db060)

The put skew on these options makes it abundantly clear that the sentiment in the short term on this company is disgustingly bearish. Also, the unprecedented amount of puts versus calls, especially for the end of March, clearly points to possible insider information on bad earnings. The sheer amount of puts also opens up the possibility of the distant cousin to the short squeeze: a Long squeeze. What is a long squeeze?

Long Squeeze: A long squeeze occurs when a sudden drop in the price of a stock or other asset incites further selling. In a long squeeze, [long](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) holders of a stock are pressured into selling their shares to protect against a dramatic loss.

However, the added pressure of massive derivatives in the underlying of $BMBL on the put side will have the effect of causing a long squeeze which will be exacerbated by a gamma ramp to the downside because of the options chain.

**Short Interest:**

Ever since 2021 and the volatility of stocks being squeezed into oblivion during the year following COVID stimulus, many traders and various trading groups and websites have taken a serious look at opportunities to squeeze various traders out of positions for major gains. However, many people do not realize that the mechanics of a squeeze can work in the reverse direction.

Under normal circumstances, market makers create a market for options by selling the options that retail traders buy. For example, when you buy a call, a market maker has to sell you that call in order to create liquidity for the financial product just in case there is not another third party willing to sell the contract. But when market makers sell options contracts, they become liable to the delta of the option that they sell. This is because each contract has a delta which is positive if you buy calls and negative if you buy puts. The delta tells you how much money the contract will make or lose for every one dollar increase in the underlying.

In order to remain delta neutral, market makers have to buy the underlying stock in the case of selling calls to retail traders. This process allows market makers to make money and remain adequately hedged regardless of the movement in the underlying price. This hedging is dynamic and changes as options expire and the underlying moves.

On February 28th 2023, Short interest on $BMBL totaled 5.77 million shorted shares. This number has increased to 9.04 million as of January 31st of this year. However, with a free float of roughly 135 million shares, there is not enough short interest to create a squeeze. On the contrary, the low amount of shorted shares actually introduces the possibility of a **crunch.**

This is because as I have shown in the above post on the options chain, the amount of open put contracts has forced market makers to be delta neutral by selling shares of $BMBL short. This means that the increase in short interest from last year until now is mostly due to market makers hedging positions due to the sheer amount of puts vs calls. Just like a gamma squeeze forces market makers to buy more stock to remain delta neutral, a gamma crunch forces market makers to sell shares short to remain delta neutral on their positions from selling put contracts.

When $BMBL stock drops on earnings, as the puts get into the money and the delta becomes more negative, market makers will be forced to sell short even more shares which will be a positive feedback loop of put options getting into the money, increasing the negative delta, and forcing market makers to sell shares to remain delta neutral. Based on the strike price of the open options, $BMBL only needs to fall to below $12.50 before market makers will be forced to offset their delta through hedging by selling short $BMBL shares.

**TL/DR:** Final EOW price for $BMBL?  <$10 all said and done. They have no path to sustainability and profitability, they have no serious MOAT, and they are losing money hand over fist.

**Positions:**

If you request counseling through WEAVE, Inc, you’ll leave a message but you’ll never get a call back. 

If your WEAVE “advocate”  leaves a message of concern on your voicemail, don’t worry, they’ll still fail to answer any of your calls directly for the next 2-3 weeks. 

If you miraculously schedule a time to speak with your victim advocate, they’ll completely disrespect you, not show up to the appointment, and fail to return any of your phone calls.  

If you leave an irritated yet desperate voicemail message still asking for help, they’ll have someone new call you in a week.  

The new advocate will call you in the morning because they know survivors love starting off their day talking about recent trauma. However, if you miss this call, they’ll never call you again. Ever.

Admitting that PM Modi is bad for the country but still willing to vote for the BJP because he's better than the 'incompetent' Rahul Gandhi is probably the stupidest opinion ever.,"This is India. We have a parliamentary form of elections. It's not Mr. Modi verses Mr. Gandhi. It's not even Congress vs BJP. It's an election where countless parties contest. 

It is clearly evident that Mr. Modi and the BJP are driving this nation into an autocratic regime. The currently elected NDA government is misusing their authority over the agencies of the Union Government. The BJP has an extremely well-built and successful propaganda machinery, called the BJIP IT Cell, that is curbing the influence of other political parties in the country. 

Not a day goes by where they do not cyberbully Mr. Gandhi. If the BJP believes that he is incompetent, why did they spend more than a decade trying to defame him? To the BJP, Mr. Gandhi is a threat. A threat that they cannot 'purchase and subdue' like the other MLAs, MPs, and political leaders they have purchased so far.

Let's make a comparison between the two:

1. Media: The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra received almost zero media attention, while any speech given Mr. Modi is broadcasted live on all of our national news channels. Indian media has reached such a sorry state that Mr. Gandhi has to upload his press conferences on his own YouTube channel while none of the **24/7 news channels** could accommodate to broadcast it in their ever-busy schedules. The BJP has complete control over the media and it is evident that no matter who the opposition is, they are going to be shunned by the media.
2. Charisma and Strongman Personality: The voters of this country should realise that we are voting the leaders who will be governing the country for the next five years. We are not voting for actors on a Bollywood fan website for the most charismatic personality. Charisma does not help in internal policy making. Strongman personality does nothing to help India's geopolitical influence in any sort. Politics and elections are not supposed to be entertainment. Showmanship exists only to sway the voters.
3. Press Conferences: Mr. Modi is never willing to face the public or the journalists. Mr. Gandhi has not shied away from it. Are we truly democratic if we never have the ability to question our elected representatives?
4. Religion: Communal violence is rising. The secularism of India is being threatened on a daily basis, and yet, there aren't many voices raising this concern. India is a home to all religions, and including atheists. The BJP advocates the dominance of one religion over others. 

The BJP wants to turn elections into something similar to the US Presidential elections. They cherry-pick the ones that are beneficial to them and drop the rest. Why can we not have a platform similar to the Presidential debates on live TV? Let Mr. Modi and Mr. Gandhi debate over the pressing issues of the nation. Let the voters see the real competencies and opinions of both leaders (and others too) and then decide who would be beneficial to the nation.

How is Mr. Gandhi incompetent when the public has not even heard of him and his work outside of the echoes of the BJP's propaganda machinery? Even a person who does neither beneficial nor harm to the country is better than a person who is detrimental. A majority of the decisions are taken by the bureaucrats and the elected representatives exist as a mere overlooking body. The miniscule decisions taken are by the elected representatives and these decisions make or break the country. Choose wisely.

Why nothing will change when Rahul Gandhi gets elected as PM.,"Y'all liberals seem to believe that Modi and the whole ""right wing"" will just disappear when RaGa gets elected. which is so fucking stupid (RaGa himself is RW btw), even if Rahul Gandi gets into power he can't shut off Godi media and BJP-RSS IT cell. Does Fox news stop spewing their fascist bullshit when Trump is not in power? Do crimes against trans, blacks and muslims stop when Biden is in power? of course not. similarly, pro-hindu propaganda from the godi media will continue and minorities will still be oppressed and terrorized by the upper caste hindus and there is nothing RaGa can do about it. motherfucker can't even build a prominent news channel to spread congressi propaganda and somehow you libs believe that he will ""undo"" the rise of hinduism in this country.

Putting the religious discourse aside, he seems to be talking about issues like unemployment and reservations. libs can tell if he's talking about anything else I'll reply in the comments.

* **Unemployment** is a systemic issue in capitalism, its a feature of the system. Unemployment allows business owners to pay less and retain workers under conditions that would otherwise cause them to quit. no prime minister holds more power than bourgeoise class of the country and if something harms their interests then it won't be done. you can't get rid of  unemployment unless you get rid of capitalism, its not that hard to understand.
* Same with **reservations**, we have had reservations for 75 years now and nothing has changed for ""lower castes"" in that time period, what makes you think RaGa can change shit? exploitation of working class is necessary for generating profit, keeping the working class busy with these made up enemies like muslims, LGBT and ""lower"" castes, so that they don't revolt against the exploitation is also yet another feature of the system, you can't uplift the oppressed groups and subsequently get rid of caste system without getting rid of the capitalism.

# what to do then? one might ask. become a fucking socialist.

Only reason I'm making this post is because I'm tired of seeing u/Dangerous_Week9887 making another post sucking that RaGa dick and all the libs in here joining him in his orgy.

Do you think Rahul Gandhi’s caste based outreach is reaching the common man?,"There is so much discussion happening about caste and reservation in online forums, mainly negative. I see a lot of complaining (from UCs, I guess) about increasing OBC reservation and not much in its favour. It makes me wonder if Rahul Gandhi’s words are only reaching the elite privileged folks. Granted a huge percentage of Indian Reddit and maybe even this sub consists of upper caste people, is there any support for schemes like this ? Rahul Gandhi’s talks on caste sometimes makes sense, sometimes doesn’t. I can’t see any overwhelming support though from anyone. Aren’t there OBC people in online spaces who are glad about getting more reservation if he gets elected ? What about downtrodden people in villages without any facilities, do you think the message is reaching them that Rahul Gandhi plans to increase reservation and also implement a caste census which can maybe help in improving their condition ?

Is Rahul Gandhi the Shinji Ikari of Endian politics?,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qbqywkcgvlc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c376e802fb3d5f96ccab2583ced11cb2f5dbdb6

I'd say that when he tore that ordinance in 2013, it was just like how Shinji rebuked his father's order to destroy Unit 04. In the series Shinji often says 'I'll never pilot an EVA again' only to pilot one a few moments later after wandering around the city for a while. Similarly Rahul goes on foreign tours every time INC loses an election, and then comes back with renewed vigour, only to go back after another defeat. Both love running away from problems.

Both are perceived as weak and indecisive. Both lost a parent at a young age. Both were put into positions of power at a point where they clearly weren't ready to hold that position. RaGa has recently begun showing passive aggressive behaviour, like when he lashed out at Kamal Nath after the loss in MP, or how he often says things which prove counterproductive for his party.

Shinji craves validation and relies heavily on others, particularly Misato, Rei and As\*ka. This dependence makes him vulnerable to manipulation and inaccessible to people outside of his circle of trust. You'll notice that almost all leaders who have deserted the Congress have cited 'inaccessible high command' among their reasons. Rahul too, has formed a circle of r-slurred advisors around himself, who call the shots for him, for example KC Venugopal.

[https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-all-are-in-rahul-s-coterie-that-runs-congress-101661536867607.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-all-are-in-rahul-s-coterie-that-runs-congress-101661536867607.html)

Furthermore, some people interpret Shinji's father Gendoh as his nemesis. In that case Narendra Modi would be Gendoh Ikari. Those who have seen the show would agree that this comparison too is quite accurate. Their personalities are exactly the same (disciplined, single minded obsession with a particular goal, never gives a straight answer to any question, etc).

Comparing RaGa to Shinji could also offer us clues about how he could stop being a loser and become an alpha. In the 4th Rebuild film, Shinji stops being a loser and becomes CHADji. After 26 years of indecisiveness and weak willed behaviour, he take action and saves himself and everyone else from his father's sinister plan and finally achieves happiness. How? It's simple.

Electoral politics is about choosing the lesser evil... And INDIA alliance is exactly that. ,"I reckon there are too many undecided apolitical people who say BJP and Congress are two sides of the same coin. However, the truth is that Congress and the INDIA alliance may be bad, but they are certainly not worse than BJP. Some of the undecided apolitical people may feel alienated by Congress' ""radical"" push for more affirmative action and the caste census, but I don't think it makes Congress akin to BJP. 

BJP engages in blatant communal bigotry. It uses central agencies like the ED to serve political vendetta. The press freedom and academic freedom indices go down almost every year. During the UPA era, the media talked about their scams, but no media criticizes the government now. UP's CM openly orders DMs to investigate any media reports criticizing the government.

As for the caste census, I believe that the Congress Party, which fought the last two elections on milquetoast centrism, felt that it needed an ideology (Mandal) to counter Hindutva politics (Kamandal) . Historically, this was the forte of parties like SP and RJD and not the Congress. In fact, historically Congress and BJP's stances on ""caste politics"" were pretty similar. 

I personally agree with the idea of a socioeconomic caste census as the data revealed by the one conducted in Bihar provides a lot of data to work with. It reveals the massive inequalities in resources. 

However, Congress's aggressive push has also resulted in BJP getting defensive on the issue of affirmative action and getting slightly desperate vis-a-vis reservation. They are now trying to communalize Congress' aggressive push for affirmative action and talk about how Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi opposed reservation. 

The truth is that this is only rhetoric. When it comes to ""caste politics"", even BJP has breached the 50% ceiling in several states, although the Supreme Court stalled it in some cases. In Haryana, after the Jat agitation, the BJP government brought 10% OBC reservation for Jats even though they are a dominant landowning community who own most of the land in the state. In Maharashtra, they brought a 10% quota for Marathas, who are a dominant caste, breaching the 50% ceiling. Centrists who don't like the BJP, but oppose ""caste politics"" must also contend with this. Of course, this is not to say that the opposition didn't support these bills. They also supported the bills for the same reason BJP did. 

I would also like to point out the 10% EWS reservation brought by the BJP also breached the 50% ceiling. The BJP advertised it as the first reservation for general castes. Was it not ""caste politics""??  I mean the definition of EWS is so lax that nearly everyone in the general category is included. (Less than 5% of families earn over 8 LPA, although privileged people like us may think otherwise) 

Even if you think from the perspective of someone who doesn't like ""caste politics"", I think BJP has all the problems that exist in the Congress, apart from communalism and authoritarianism. Congress is clearly the lesser evil.

An ideal INDIA Alliance Manifesto,"I personally feel that these are the most critical issues plaguing the country which the Opposition really needs to double down on:

1. **Education reform:** India's demography is its biggest strength. If we do not focus on education now, everyone is doomed. We are in dire need of a massive education revolution. The Alliance needs to promise a significant upscaling of the number of schools across the country with special focus on rural areas. Schools with adequate staffing are the need of the hour. The number of schools per district would be determined on the basis of the population of that district and accordingly they would be constructed and staffed. A special committee can be created at the state level for the monitoring of such schools along with accountability and performance based evaluation and grants depending on how the students perform in their Board examinations / state-level examinations.
2. **Measures to improve enrolment in schools:** While the government might focus on creating new schools, it also needs to ensure that there is adequate enrolment in the schools. The same can be improved through various initiatives like how Stalin has done in TN by introducing breakfast as well apart from mid-day meals in government schools. A good breakfast and mid-day meal scheme would encourage a significant number of parents to send their children to school. Further, the basic requirements such as notebooks, textbooks and school uniforms should be provided to the students for free to ensure that such requirements don't act as a constraint for the parents from enrolling their kids in schools.
3. **Employment generation:** The solution to unemployment is to create employment opportunities instead of removing the reservation cap in a situation where we already are falling far behind in terms of generation of employment as compared to the increasing workforce. The rural employment can be addressed wit the help of replicating or reinventing MNREGA scheme to suit the current situation and establish micro-industries within villages which in turn would generate employment opportunities in non-seasonal months such as involving people in stitching, weaving, handicrafts, pottery, making shoes, wallets and purses, and earning wages in the process which would help them improve their standard of living. For urban areas, they would be focusing on manufacturing sector which has been slowing down despite manufacturers moving out of China. A capable Government can enact policies which would encourage the corporates including foreign companies to establish manufacturing plants in India. The Alliance can promise that they'd ensure that they'd create a favourable business environment given the fact that FDI has been massively hit and reaching new lows under the current regime. The Alliance can promise to implement policies which would not be catered to the need of just a couple of family-run businesses but instead policies that would encourage healthy competition which would thereby create better and equal opportunities for all.
4. **Women Safety:** Women safety has taken a massive hit over the last couple of decades and there is an urgent need to work towards strengthening the laws around this. The Government needs to set up special courts which would only and only be related to cases pertaining to s\*xual harassment / s\*xual exploitation / r\*pe including marital r\*pe which should be fast tracked and as soon as strong evidence is established, there should be immediate action which may range from rigorous imprisonment, life imprisonment and capital punishment depending on the gravity of the crime. Awareness for the same should be spread so that it'd act as a deterrent for people from committing such crimes.
5. **Healthcare:** We've significantly fallen behind on healthcare over the last decade wherein healthcare is becoming more and more unaffordable and barely any new affordable government hospitals are being opened which would facilitate the welfare of the poor people. Something as basic as mohalla clinics is a brilliant idea that can help partly address this problem and it can be implemented in the same manner that it has been done in Delhi as it is a highly scalable model. Healthcare is the need of the hour with such a fast-growing population not having any access to affordable healthcare.
6. **Minimum Support Price to farmers:** Minimum support price should be enacted in spirit to ensure that the farmers are able to sustain themselves and not end up working as slaves to corporate owners on their own farms. The proper implementation of MSP will be critical as it has the potential to modernize Indian agriculture which has been ignored consistently over the last decade except when corporates lobbied to come down on them like vultures.
7. **Youth upskilling:** India has lost the last decade debating on religion, caste, temples and mosques. If we spend any further time and energy on this, the demographic dividend will end up as a demographic disaster. Multiple reports suggest that Indian youth are becoming unemployable. If urgent action is not taken in the direction of upskilling the youth then the youth will end up becoming a liability instead of being an asset. Various upskilling centres are required to set up across all metro cities where youth can learn critical skills which would help them ride the AI wave which has turned its head towards India like a tsunami and is an impending disaster which no one is paying heed to.
8. **Free temples from state control:** This will actually dent the BJP in a huge way which kept on saying before 2014 that state control should be removed from temples and was one of the main talking points. If Congress can manage to promise this, it has the ability to improve their winnability quite significantly. It can be a sheer masterstroke.
9. **Improve the condition of long distance trains and increase the number of trains which have constantly been ignored by the incumbent government so that they could promote Vande Bharat:** This promise will benefit the poor and middle class especially the migrants in a massive way. Barely any new trains or new trains have been launched over the last decade just to push Vande Bharat on the forefront which is causing a significant burden on the existing trains which are being forced to cater to the growing population without an increase in the number of rakes or frequency.",37,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1brozxx/an_ideal_india_alliance_manifesto/,1brozxx,13.0,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1brozxx/an_ideal_india_alliance_manifesto/,2024-03-31 00:12:01

INDIA alliance theory ,"My theory is this: the Deep state Brahmin-Baniya has accumulated enough wealthy and they know if modi continues economy will become disaster and people's tolerance will be breached. Major goals mandir, A370, privatisation are achieved. Now the deep state plans to bring Cong to bring some balance to economy, external relations and prevent any mass uprising against the state. Modi will be made irrelevant after election and sangh will get time to groom their next modi for the next stage of hindutva. CongRSS understands this and will never undo anything. Tamilnadu will be sangified through caste no doubt in it. When Modi says adani is giving money to Rahul, i infer that it is because adani is not giving that money to modi. No balakot like shocking news to change narrative, z news not reporting Modi etc makes me feel that BJP is losing the control over narrative and external agents benefiting from bjp is slowly drifting away from them. Stock market is also showing some signals as i feel big whales are slowly booking profits and exiting. Modi is totally unhinged and let to speak his mind without any filters. Signs of deep state nexus dumping him off totally.

"US-India Alliance: I Give You IT Contracts, You Help Me Fight China","I work in IT in the US and I've noticed recently (since Biden came into office) that our (as in American companies) dependence on Indian contractors and Indian IT companies has increased dramatically. It was already a heavy reliance before but ever since Biden got into office everything seemed to have accelerated and criticism of Prime Minister Modi has been kept to almost silence in the media. Clearly what is happening here is that Biden is pinning all of America's hopes and dreams in the Indo-Pacific on this alliance with India. In other words, this is a case of ""I'll give you IT contracts and work if you help me contain China."" 

India was famously non-aligned during the Cold War. It didn't get rich from that strategy but it stayed out of trouble and was able to get what it wanted from both sides without becoming abrasive to one side or the other. Due to this history, can India be trusted as a partner to counter China? Modi isn't exactly an ideal democratic figure as he is the most rightwing and divisive figure in India's modern democratic history. 

Lastly, is the trading of IT contracts for loyalty worth it for the US in the long-term? Obviously, this question serves as a reminder that the US used the same ""jobs for alliance"" strategy with China in the 70s to take advantage of the Sino-Soviet Split, and as they say, the rest was history - the Soviets collapsed and the Chinese got rich. And what did America get? Superpower status in the short-term but poverty in the long term (the US gave all of its jobs and strategic manufacturing capabilities away to China).

The difficulty of forming an alliance between India and the United States to confront China is quite high.,"**Teaming Up Against China: The Challenges for an India-US Alliance**

There are many structural differences between India and the USA, making it hard to imagine a long-term or even semi-alliance between them.

1. **Economic Support**: The USA lacks the ability to provide significant long-term economic benefits to India. It can't offer infrastructure or large-scale economic aid. Theoretically, it could leverage its market to support India, but this doesn't align with economic principles or the profit motives of American businesses. East Asia, Southeast Asia, and even Mexico are far better suited as sources for American imports. Going against economic principles and profit motives isn't typical for the USA and would require a strong, consistent policy execution, which is unrealistic for American politics.

2. **Military Assistance**: The USA lacks the capability to militarily rescue India. In case of a prolonged war between India and China, the USA could indeed distract China. However, the most likely scenario is a short, intense conflict at the border. In such a situation, American military intervention would be minimal. Think about it: what can the USA really do? Attack mainland China? Send troops to the India-China border? Providing some intelligence and weapons is possible, but the conflict might end before the weapons are even used. And if the USA gives substantial support and India still loses (which is quite possible), it would tarnish the credibility of American military aid and weapon sales globally.

3. **Independence and Equality**: India values its independence highly, while the USA struggles to accept equal partnerships. This deep-rooted American mindset is hard to change without significant setbacks. Paradoxically, if the USA could truly treat India as an equal, China might actually welcome it. Although it would increase pressure on China, the shift in the American mindset would be more significant. If the USA accepts India as an equal, could accepting China's superiority be far behind?

4. **Timing**: It's too late for the USA to ally with India effectively. Currently, India's ability to drain China's economic and political resources is too weak. Compare this to China's impact on the Soviet Union from the late '60s to the '80s (e.g., the Zhenbao Island conflict, Soviet troops in the Far East and Mongolia, ideological battles, guerrilla warfare in Africa, the Sino-Vietnamese War, the Soviet-Afghan War, etc.). Even if India rises to powerfully counter China, it will take years. Meanwhile, the USA is already being surpassed by China and is facing severe political and economic crises. A costly alliance that doesn't address America's immediate problems is hard to justify.

5. **Long-term Consequences**: If India rises strongly, the USA will drop to the third global rank, with the East fully eclipsing the West. Even if the USA supports India for a while, it will become clear that China's economic strength far surpasses the USA's before India can catch up to China. Thus, India would have to surpass the USA first to effectively counter China. The USA might suffer the pain of becoming number three without reaping the benefits of a major China-India showdown. How would the USA handle that?

6. **China's Future Debates**: In the 2030s, China might have a major debate on whether to prioritize dealing with the USA or India. While officially this might be avoided, popular opinion could influence government attitudes. If a consensus forms to target one, the scenario could shift in that direction by the mid-2030s. Even if it doesn't, the 2050s might see another push. Each generation wants to achieve something significant, and by the 2030s or 2050s, the Chinese public might feel that the ""great rejuvenation"" is complete and seek new goals. Historically, being a long-term target of China is daunting. (I'll write more on this later.)

   A bizarre situation could arise: in the 2030s, the country (the USA or India) with more troubles and weaker economic performance might actually be safer from China's focus in the long term.

In short, Indian and American strategists might soon realize the huge risk of being China's primary target. Both sides would prefer the other to be targeted while they reap the benefits. This mindset makes forming a solid alliance difficult. China's decision-making and execution capabilities allow it to adopt a strategy of ""targeting one while letting the other benefit,"" making it hard for the targeted country to maintain an alliance with the beneficiary.

7. **Potential for Change**: Of course, if China acts irrationally, it could force a strong, stable US-India alliance. This is similar to how American strategists often list reasons why a long-term Sino-Russian alliance is unlikely, yet poor US policies have pushed China and Russia closer over the past 30 years. However, there's a difference: the USA has almost no chance of winning against a Sino-Russian quasi-alliance due to its smaller scale.

Shame on opposition parties for they failed to keep the alliance intact even after naming it INDIA,"Today, Mamata Banerjee said that her party will fight alone on all the 42 seats of West Bengal.

If wasn't enough, just a couple of hours later, Bhagwant Mann, the CM of Punjab gave a statement that his party (AAP) won't spare a single seat for the Congress in Punjab. If there's no alliance between AAP & Congress in *Punjab* that means no alliance in states like *Delhi, Haryana, Gujarat and Goa*, too.

And ever since the Modi government has announced *Bharat Ratna for Karpuri Thakur*, former Bihar CM and an OBC stalwart who introduced reservations for the OBC in the Bihar government jobs, the JD(U) and its leader, Nitish Kumar have been singing songs of praises for Narendra Modi and the BJP.

It's 99% certain that JD(U) is also breaking up with the INDIA alliance. The irony is that Nitish Kumar stitched the whole INDIA alliance and he started putting his efforts in August, 2022.

Which brings us to no alliance in *West Bengal, Punjab, Delhi, Haryana, Gujarat and Bihar*, which means that we are gonna have a repeat of 2019 where Congress fought in alliance with RJD in *Bihar*, JMM in *Jharkhand*, DMK in *Tamilnadu*. There was one more ally, JD(S) in *Karnataka* who will fight with the BJP this time around.

Now, the only state which is left to discuss is *Maharashtra* where everyone knows what is happening.

Tbh, when the INDIA alliance was announced, the whole country, especially the redditors (especially from some specific subreddits) were looking at them with high hopes but today, they left millions of Indians disappointed.

I never ever, even in my wildest of dreams imagined that one day, I'll have to write something like this but I'm gonna write it anyway.

It took Erdogan 20 years to change the secular nature of Turkey. Modi has already had 10 years. And the secular and democratic fabric of this country is more broken than I can remember, in the last 40 years.


If you vote for the BJP after what they have done, you deserve to suffer.
Politics
BJP has set up a template which will effectively kill India's democracy and pluralism.
*   Complete destruction of independent media - mainstream media is a mouthpiece of the BJP, any independent voices are either harassed via IT raids/ relentless hate campaigns via IT cell/false cases : modi's puppet buys up the channel for his and his master's collective profit.
*   Destroying already fragile communal harmony through consistent polarization and hate campaigns via the internet, media and support to political goons.
Need I say more about the skyrocketing in the bigoted sentiments in our society today? Lynchings, second class treatment to first muslims, then sikhs during the farmers' protest.
*   The govt botched their handling of Covid and very conveniently blamed it on the states claiming no one died in the second wave. They were interested in claiming that they had won instead of handling the crisis.
*   The Ram Mandir issue has been used as a shopper stop coupon to stiffle down any and every criticism of the govt and in the same vain every critic is now demonised as an anti- national, anti- hindu, communist, etc.
*   Destorying govt institutions and political opponents via them - C.B.I and E.D have now been reduced to very persuasive recruitment arms of the govt which facil:* oppostion party politicians to come into the BJP fo
N.S.A and U.A.P.A are used as silencers on any and every dissent they see as problematic. Election


Playing with people's religious emotions and minority hatred same like Hitler had done and now Erdogan (Turkish PM) is doing 

1.Hitler- Made propoganda that Aryans are superior and will rule the world 
Made Jews second class citizens and blame Germany's WW2 failure on them
2.Erdogan- Made propoganda that Ottoman Empire will rule the world
Projecting Europeans and non muslims evil and blame Turkey's economic and social problems on them
3.BJP- Made propoganda that akhand Bharat will be a reality and they will rule all over South Asia.

Indi alliance internally is not democratic at all,"I recently saw a post which states that i am voting for indi because i wanna save democracy. 

Now i don't understand how the hell is indi parties are democratic

Congress - Rahul Gandhi lost 2 elections in a row badly and still is the main face , tell me where is democracy in congress party.

Samajwadi - These people saved goons like vikas dubey, mukhtar ansari, atiq ahmed and countless. Plus akhilesh yadav lost every election and still the party face

Lalu - Never won since 2006, still his family is in heart of the party, plus if he comes to power specifically every woman could not get out of their house after 6pm, go ask situation of bihar in lalu raj

Mamta - Although won election, but where is the guarantee that she will not kill opposition's entire cadre. Remember after state elections of bengal, how congress and bjp's karkartyas were killed.

You - Modi's bad

 Me - Okay, tell me better alternative 

You - Indi Alliance

Me - Understandable, have a good day. Let me book my student visa to USA in case Indi comes to power

On a serious note, if you say that democracy is in danger in here, it is not shame for bjp but for the country that's how easy you lie. If you have a problem with mayor election then change the bloody ballot system to evm.

Don't forget that this anti-defection law, giving quasi judiciary power to ed,cbi was done by upa which is not taken back by nda.

Penske - Foyt Alliance at Indy,"Anyone else think Penske did this technical alliance with Foyt obviously for Miles Rowe in 25 BUT also for Foyt's engineering info at Indy?

Yes Newgarden just won the Indy 500 BUT he only led 5 laps. In my opinion the win is more credit to mechanical handling, superior tire wear, Josef's own skill, and friendly timing (I'm truly not a Penske conspiracy theorist. Truth is though the Indy 500 is so often about timing, and in 2023 the timing was with the # 2).

But Penske cars still qualified like crap again. Not 2021 levels of crap but still crappy.

McLaughlin was stuck in the teens. I'm sure some of this is McLaughlin for all his success and talent probably needs to improve as a driver at Indy but I don't think he's had the best cars either. 

Hard to tell what Power had. He looked on par with Josef early, had the weight jacker break, was stuck in the teens till he hit the wall.

Hard for anyone to keep the lead at Indy 500 but again Josef only led 5 laps, and I don't recall him leading any laps consecutively (it wasn't more than 2 if he did). He seemed to handle good in traffic but lacked straight line speed out front. Erricson almost caught back up to him.

If you look at the Foyt cars. They out qualified the Penske cars. We know Santino is good at Indy at this point but recently unemployed driver Benjamin Pederson out qualified them too. The Foyt cars seemed to have better straight line speed than the Penske. 

Any chance Penske did this for engineering help for the Indy 500? Because if you look at the laps led and qualifying they really haven't had the speed, Josef just had one perfect race. Obviously they were happy to win the race but they probably know they still need to get faster.",23,INDYCAR,https://www.reddit.com/r/INDYCAR/comments/193v7g5/penske_foyt_alliance_at_indy/,193v7g5,18.0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/INDYCAR/comments/193v7g5/penske_foyt_alliance_at_indy/,2024-01-11 12:07:01

What is the mood of your locality? ,"Away from social media, have you spoken to people around you? We are people from different states and cities, lets discuss the ground level buzz around Loksabha elections 


This has been my experience talking to people from following States, keep in mind that sample size is very small, I am not saying this will happen, as many will share their experiences we'll try to come to a consensus regarding ground reality of this election 



AP/TS - Mixed response. I am from Hyderabad, I have seen a lot of polarization tactics in last few months and have seen it working too but lets see what happens, so far I don't see overwhelming support for anyone 


Chhattisgarh - In Chhattisgarh, I got to know that Rahul Gandhi's 8000 rupees/month for all women has reached tribal area and most likely women will vote for him while men are voting for Modi 

There has been a lot of politics regarding reservation % in this area, that'd be a factor too 


Madhya Pradesh - Satna is going for Congress or BSP because the candidate of both parties are popular however sentiments have been pretty Anti-Modi in the region 

One guy I spoke to said that we don't have any option, People vote for BJP in Madhya Pradesh that's why we have to vote too but there should be an option.

I spoke to a family which always votes for BJP, they were Pro BJP but were complaining about people not going to polling station to vote 



Delhi-Haryana - People in Haryana are firmly with INDI alliance, they were pretty vocal about their hate for BJP 

Mixed response from Delhi 


Maharashtra - I have spoken to a lot of people from Maharashtra and mixed response here too. People supporting BJP are as aggressive as people opposing BJP 




My observation - 


1 Women voter which were primary vote bank of BJP might vote for Congress in some regions 


2 SC/ST voters are voting for INDI alliance 


3 There's no Modi wave, there are people who love him and treat him like a Messiah but things have changed considerably 

4 BJP will not be able to form government without NDA alliance and maybe they'll need more help 

5 If women and ST/SC voters shift to INDI alliance then there's a possibility that INDI alliance will get as many seats as NDA got in 2019

What's your views on tomorrow elections?,"Hey Delhiites, So I am from North East Delhi side and I am going to vote for the first time and the major contestants are Manoj Tiwari from BJP and Kanhaiya Kumar from INDI Alliance. So I was looking for who will be the better for us and I am not sure who should I go for.

When it comes to Manoj Tiwari, I have seen some of his interviews and I can tell you he ain't know any shit about politics or anything related to the politics. He is the kind of candidate who only shows his face during the election. He is just using MoDi's name for his win.

On the other hand, I have heard about Kanhaiya Kumar and trust me it's not very good. He is former president of JNUSU and he often referred as anti national for his speeches. He is a doctorate and he has good knowledge about politics.

I don't know who should should I go for, both are not from Delhi and Both have criminal cases.

What are your views?

Edit: I am not going to vote based on some reddit replies  as I am doing my research and I just want to know the perspective of the people about the contenders.",120,delhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1czf4rl/whats_your_views_on_tomorrow_elections/,1czf4rl,450.0,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1czf4rl/whats_your_views_on_tomorrow_elections/,2024-05-24 12:57:44

I am supporting CONgress and RCB. हाथ बदलेगा हालात ।,"How RCB qualifying in IPL playoffs is a sign that INDI Alliance is forming govt after 4th june:

•Kohli is married to a film star, INDI Alliance leader Raghav Chaddha is married to a film star.

•Siddaramaih was supporting RCB, Siddaramaih is supporting INDI Alliance.

•Virat Kohli left captaincy of RCB, Rahul Gandhi left presidency of Congress.

•This is last IPL of Dhoni, this is last election of Modi ji.

•Kohli has six pack abs, Rahul Gandhi has six pack abs.

•Owner of RCB looted public money, Owners of Congress looted public money.

Do you think all these are just coincidences?

If SBI stays adamant on not releasing the EB data then would that help NDA or INDIA?,"I believe that both ways, INDI Alliance can use it to its advantage but i dont see that smart step by them.

Rant about the current state of Politics,"I might be downvoted for this but go ahead. 

First of all, let me clarify that I'm going to vote for Congress and I do believe that Rahul Gandhi can be a much better Prime Minister than Narendra Modi by a huge margin.

Now coming to the rant. I still think Congress or the whole opposition could've performed much better if they were very active. 

1) They should have formed the INDI alliance a long before and released their manifesto sooner. The opposition should've coordinated their attacks. 
2) Bharat Jodo Yatra was a big success for Rahul Gandhi. And I think it did make a huge difference at the ground level. Rahul Gandhi has improved a lot. But I still think people will not perceive him as a strong leader until and unless he governs an important position and shows his loyalty to development. 
3) Although we have parliamentary elections where we choose our representative from our constituency, people do not perceive it this way. For them it's Rahul vs Modi. It's the sad truth but Social Media/News sets the narrative and this narrative is in Modi's favour. 

""Modi nahi toh kon?""


Now, I personally do think they'll not be performing better than 2019 elections because the narrative that Modi is honest has fallen a little, Rahul Gandhi Bharat Jodo Yatra improved his chances, Farmer's agitation, Ladakh, Manipur etc. But would it matter? BJP has unlimited funds and might buy winning opposition candidates to get 400 paar.

I really think they should name a PM candidate like Shashi Tharoor and keep Rahul as the frontman.
